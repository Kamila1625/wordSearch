(disambiguation).
Kepler is a space observatory launched by NASA to discover
Earth-size planets orbiting other stars.
[5][6] Named
after astronomer Johannes Kepler,
[7] the spacecraft was
launched on March 7, 2009,[8] into an Earth-trailing
heliocentric orbit.
Designed to survey a portion of our region of the Milky
Way to discover Earth-size exoplanetsin or near habitable
zones and estimate how many of the billions of stars in the
Milky Way have such planets,[5][9][10] Kepler's sole scientific
instrument is a photometer that continually monitors
the brightness of over 145,000 main sequence stars in a
fixed field of view.[11] These data are transmitted to Earth,
then analyzed to detect periodic dimming caused by exoplanets
that cross in front of their host star.
Kepler is part of NASA’s Discovery Program of relatively
low-cost, focused primary science missions. The
telescope’s construction and initial operation were managed
by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with Ball
Aerospace responsible for developing the Kepler flight
system. The Ames Research Center is responsible for
the ground system development, mission operations since
December 2009, and scientific data analysis. The initial
planned lifetime was 3.5 years,[12] but greater-thanexpected
noise in the data, from both the stars and the
spacecraft, meant additional time was needed to fulfill
all mission goals. Initially, in 2012, the mission was
expected to be extended until 2016,[13] but on July 14,
2012, one of the spacecraft’s four reaction wheels used
for pointing the spacecraft stopped turning, and completing
the mission would only be possible if all other reaction
wheels remained reliable.[14] Then, on May 11, 2013, a
second reaction wheel failed, disabling the collection of
science data[15] and threatening the continuation of the
mission.[16]
On August 15, 2013, NASA announced that they had
given up trying to fix the two failed reaction wheels.
This meant the current mission needed to be modified,
but it did not necessarily mean the end of planet hunting.
NASA had asked the space science community to
propose alternative mission plans “potentially including
an exoplanet search, using the remaining two good reaction
wheels and thrusters”.[17][18][19][20] On November
18, 2013, the K2 “Second Light” proposal was reported.
This would include utilizing the disabled Kepler in a way
that could detect habitable planets around smaller, dimmer
red dwarfs.
[21][22][23][24] On May 16, 2014, NASA
announced the approval of the K2 extension.[25]
As of January 2015, Kepler and its follow-up observations
had found 1,013 confirmed exoplanets in about
440 star systems, along with a further 3,199 uncon-
firmed planet candidates.[upper-alpha 2][26][27] Four planets
have been confirmed through Kepler's K2 mission.[28] In
November 2013, astronomers estimated, based on Kepler
space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion
rocky, Earth-size exoplanets orbiting in the habitable
zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarfs within the Milky
Way.
[29][30][31] It is estimated that 11 billion of these planets
may be orbiting Sun-like stars.[32] The nearest such
planet may be 3.7 parsecs (12 ly) away, according to the
scientists.[29][30]
On January 6, 2015, NASA announced the 1,000th con-
firmed exoplanet discovered by the Kepler Space Telescope.
Four of the newly confirmed exoplanets were
found to orbit within habitable zones of their related stars:
three of the four, Kepler-438b, Kepler-442b and Kepler-
452b, are almost Earth-size and likely rocky; the fourth,
Kepler-440b, is a super-Earth.
[33] On May 10, 2016,
NASA verified 1,284 new exoplanetsfound by Kepler, the
single largest finding of planets to date.[34][35][36]
Since 1988, over 3,000 exoplanets have been confirmed
by all detection methods, including the Kepler mission
(specifically, 3,607 planets in 2,701 planetary systems,
including 610 multiple planetary systems, have been con-
firmed, as of April 1, 2017).[37]
1 Spacecraft
The spacecraft has a mass of 1,039 kilograms (2,291 lb)
and contains a Schmidt camera with a 0.95-meter (37.4
in) front corrector plate (lens) feeding a 1.4-meter (55
in) primary mirror – at the time of its launch this was
the largest mirror on any telescope outside Earth orbit,[38]
though the Herschel Space Observatory took this title a
few months later. The spacecraft has a 115 deg2
(about
12-degree diameter) field of view (FOV), roughly equivalent
to the size of one’s fist held at arm’s length. Of
this, 105 deg2
is of science quality, with less than 11%
vignetting. The photometer has a soft focus to provide
excellent photometry, rather than sharp images. The mis-
1

sion goal is a combined differential photometric precision
(CDPP) of 20 ppm for a m(V)=12 Sun-like star for a
6.5-hour integration, though the observations so far have
fallen short of this objective (see mission status). An
Earth-size planet transit produces a brightness change of
84 ppm and lasts for thirteen hours when it crosses the
midline of the star.
1.1 Camera
Kepler's image sensor array. The array is curved to account for
Petzval field curvature.
The focal plane of the spacecraft’s camera is made
out of forty-two 50 × 25 mm (2 × 1 in) CCDs at
2200×1024 pixels each, possessing a total resolution of
94.6 megapixels,
[39][40] which at the time made it the
largest camera system launched into space.[12] The array
is cooled by heat pipes connected to an external
radiator.[41] The CCDs are read out every six seconds (to
limit saturation) and co-added on board for 58.89 seconds
for short cadence targets, and 1765.5 seconds (29.4 minutes)
for long cadence targets. Due to the larger bandwidth
requirements for the former, these are limited in
number to 512 compared to 170,000 for long cadence.
However, even though at launch Kepler had the highest
data rate of any NASA mission , the 29-minute sums of
all 95 million pixels constitute more data than can be
stored and sent back to Earth. Therefore, the science
team has pre-selected the relevant pixels associated with
each star of interest, amounting to about 6 percent of
the pixels (5.4 megapixels). The data from these pixels
is then requantized, compressed and stored, along with
other auxiliary data, in the on-board 16 gigabyte solidstate
recorder. Data that is stored and downlinked includes
science stars, p-mode stars, smear, black level,
background and full field-of-view images.[41][42]
1.2 Primary mirror
Arecibo radio telescope at the same scale
Overwhelmingly Large Telescope
Comparison of primary mirror sizes for the Kepler spacecraft
and other notable optical telescopes.
The Kepler primary mirror is 1.4 meters (4.6 ft) in diameter.
Manufactured by glass maker Corning using ultralow
expansion (ULE) glass, the mirror is specifically designed
to have a mass only 14% that of a solid mirror
of the same size.[43][44] In order to produce a space telescope
system with sufficient sensitivity to detect relatively
small planets, as they pass in front of stars, a very high
reflectance coating on the primary mirror was required.
Using ion assisted evaporation, Surface Optics Corp. applied
a protective 9-layer silver coating to enhance re-
flection and a dielectric interference coating to minimize
the formation of color centers and atmospheric moisture
absorption.[45][46]
1.3 Performance
In terms of photometric performance, Kepler has worked
well, much better than any Earth-bound telescope, but
1.5 Spacecraft operations 3
still short of the design goals. The objective was a combined
differential photometric precision (CDPP) of 20
parts per million (PPM) on a magnitude 12 star for a 6.5-
hour integration. This estimate was developed allowing
10 ppm for stellar variability, roughly the value for the
Sun. The obtained accuracy for this observation has a
wide range, depending on the star and position on the focal
plane, with a median of 29 ppm. Most of the additional
noise appears to be due to a larger-than-expected
variability in the stars themselves (19.5 ppm as opposed
to the assumed 10.0 ppm), with the rest due to instrumental
noise sources slightly larger than predicted.[47] Work is
ongoing to better understand, and perhaps calibrate out,
instrument noise.[39]
Because the signal from an Earth-size planet is so close to
the noise level (only 80 ppm), the increased noise means
each individual transit is only a 2.7 σ event, instead of
the intended 4 σ. This, in turn, means more transits must
be observed to be sure of a detection. Scientific estimates
indicated that a mission lasting 7 to 8 years, as opposed to
the originally planned 3.5 years, would be needed to find
all transiting Earth-sized planets.[48] On April 4, 2012,
the Kepler mission was approved for extension through
the fiscal year 2016,[13][49] but this also depended on all
remaining reaction wheels staying healthy, which turned
out not to be the case (see Spacecraft history below).
1.4 Spacecraft orbit and orientation
Kepler's search volume, in the context of the Milky Way
Kepler orbits the Sun,
[50][51] which avoids Earth
occultations, stray light, and gravitational perturbations
and torques inherent in an Earth orbit.
NASA has characterized Kepler's orbit as “Earthtrailing”.[52]
With an orbital period of 372.5 days, Kepler
slowly falls farther behind Earth (about 16 million miles
per annum). By April 2016, Kepler was about 100 million
miles from Earth.[53]
Until 2013 the photometer was pointed to a field in the
northern constellations of Cygnus, Lyra and Draco, which
is well out of the ecliptic plane, so that sunlight never enters
the photometer as the spacecraft orbits.[41]
This is also the direction of the Solar System’s motion
around the center of the galaxy. Thus, the stars which
Kepler observed are roughly the same distance from the
galactic center as the Solar System, and also close to the
galactic plane. This fact is important if position in the
galaxy is related to habitability, as suggested by the Rare
Earth hypothesis.
1.5 Spacecraft operations
Kepler's orbit. The spacecraft’s solar array is adjusted at solstices
and equinoxes.
Kepler is operated out of Boulder, Colorado, by the
Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP)
under contract to Ball Aerospace & Technologies. The
spacecraft’s solar array is rotated to face the Sun at the
solstices and equinoxes, so as to optimize the amount of
sunlight falling on the solar array and to keep the heat radiator
pointing towards deep space.[41] Together, LASP
and Ball Aerospace control the spacecraft from a mission
operations center located on the research campus of the
University of Colorado. LASP performs essential mission
planning and the initial collection and distribution of
the science data. The mission’s initial life-cycle cost was
estimated at US$600 million, including funding for 3.5
years of operation.[41] In 2012, NASA announced that
the Kepler mission would be funded until 2016.[13]
1.5.1 Communications
NASA contacts the spacecraft using the X band communication
link twice a week for command and status updates.
Scientific data are downloaded once a month using
the Kₐ band link at a maximum data transfer rate of approximately
550 kB/s. The Kepler spacecraft conducts
4 1 SPACECRAFT
its own partial analysis on board and only transmits scientific
data deemed necessary to the mission in order to
conserve bandwidth.[54]
1.5.2 Data management
Science data telemetry collected during mission operations
at LASP is sent for processing to the Kepler Data
Management Center (DMC) which is located at the Space
Telescope Science Institute on the campus of Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, Maryland. The science
data telemetry is decoded and processed into uncalibrated
FITS-format science data products by the DMC, which
are then passed along to the Science Operations Center
(SOC) at NASA Ames Research Center, for calibration
and final processing. The SOC at NASA Ames Research
Center (ARC) develops and operates the tools needed to
process scientific data for use by the Kepler Science Of-
fice (SO). Accordingly, the SOC develops the pipeline
data processing software based on scientific algorithms
developed by the SO. During operations, the SOC:
1. Receives calibrated pixel data from the DMC
2. Applies the analysis algorithms to produce light
curves for each star
3. Performs transit searches for detection of planets
(threshold-crossing events, or TCEs)
4. Performs data validation of candidate planets by
evaluating various data products for consistency as
a way to eliminate false positive detections
The SOC also evaluates the photometric performance
on an ongoing basis and provides the performance metrics
to the SO and Mission Management Office. Finally,
the SOC develops and maintains the project’s scientific
databases, including catalogs and processed data. The
SOC finally returns calibrated data products and scientific
results back to the DMC for long-term archiving, and
distribution to astronomers around the world through the
Multimission Archive at STScI (MAST).
1.6 Spacecraft history
In January 2006, the project’s launch was delayed eight
months because of budget cuts and consolidation at
NASA.[55] It was delayed again by four months in March
2006 due to fiscal problems.[55] At this time, the highgain
antenna was changed from a gimbal-led design to
one fixed to the frame of the spacecraft to reduce cost
and complexity, at the cost of one observation day per
month.
The Kepler observatory was launched on March 7, 2009,
at 03:49:57 UTC aboard a Delta II rocket from Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.[2][8] The launch was
Kepler's launch on March 7, 2009
a success and all three stages were completed by 04:55
UTC. The cover of the telescope was jettisoned on April
7, 2009, and the first light images were taken on the next
day.[56][57]
On April 20, 2009, it was announced that the Kepler science
team had concluded that further refinement of the
focus would dramatically increase the scientific return.[58]
On April 23, 2009, it was announced that the focus had
been successfully optimized by moving the primary mirror
40 micrometers (1.6 thousandths of an inch) towards
the focal plane and tilting the primary mirror 0.0072
degree.[59]
On May 13, 2009, at 00:01 UTC, Kepler successfully
completed its commissioning phase and began its search
for planets around other stars.[60][61]
On June 19, 2009, the spacecraft successfully sent its first
science data to Earth. It was discovered that Kepler had
entered safe mode on June 15. A second safe mode event
occurred on July 2. In both cases the event was triggered
by a processor reset. The spacecraft resumed normal
operation on July 3 and the science data that had been
collected since June 19 was downlinked that day.[62] On
October 14, 2009, the cause of these safing events was
determined to be a low voltage power supply that provides
power to the RAD750 processor.[63] On January 12,
2010, one portion of the focal plane transmitted anoma-

lous data, suggesting a problem with focal plane MOD-3
module, covering two out of Kepler's 42 CCDs. As of
October 2010, the module was described as “failed”, but
the coverage still exceeded the science goals.[64]
Kepler downlinked roughly twelve gigabytes of data[65]
about once per month[66]—an example of such a downlink
was on November 22–23, 2010.[67]
1.6.1 Reaction wheel failures
On July 14, 2012, one of the four reaction wheels used
for fine pointing of the spacecraft failed.[68] While Kepler
requires only three reaction wheels to accurately aim the
telescope, another failure would leave the spacecraft unable
to aim at its original field.[69]
After showing some problems in January 2013, a second
reaction wheel failed on May 11, 2013, stopping
the Kepler primary mission. The spacecraft was put
into safe mode, then from June to August 2013 a series
of engineering tests were done to try to recover either
failed wheel. By August 15, 2013, it was decided that
the wheels were unrecoverable,[17][18][19] An engineering
report was ordered to assess the spacecraft’s remaining
capabilities.[17]
This effort ultimately led to the “K2” follow-on mission
observing different fields near the ecliptic.
2 Field of view
Kepler has a fixed field of view (FOV) against the sky.
The diagram to the right shows the celestial coordinates
and where the detector fields are located, along with the
locations of a few bright stars with celestial north at the
top left corner. The mission website has a calculator that
will determine if a given object falls in the FOV, and if
so, where it will appear in the photo detector output data
stream. Data on exoplanet candidates is submitted to the
Kepler Follow-up Program, or KFOP, to conduct followup
observations.
Kepler's field of view covers 115 square degrees, around
0.25 percent of the sky, or “about two scoops of the Big
Dipper”. Thus, it would require around 400 Kepler-like
telescopes to cover the whole sky.[70] The Kepler field
contains portions of the constellations Cygnus, Lyra, and
Draco.
3 Objectives and methods
Diagram of Kepler's investigated area with celestial coordinates
The scientific objective of Kepler is to explore the structure
and diversity of planetary systems.
[71] This spacecraft
observes a large sample of stars to achieve several
key goals:
6 3 OBJECTIVES AND METHODS
• To determine how many Earth-size and larger planets
there are in or near the habitable zone (often
called “Goldilocks planets”)[72] of a wide variety of
spectral types of stars.
• To determine the range of size and shape of the orbits
of these planets.
• To estimate how many planets there are in multiplestar
systems.
• To determine the range of orbit size, brightness,
size, mass and density of short-period giant planets.
• To identify additional members of each discovered
planetary system using other techniques.
• Determine the properties of those stars that harbor
planetary systems.
The photometer’s field of view in the constellations Cygnus, Lyra
and Draco
Most of the exoplanets previously detected by other
projects were giant planets, mostly the size of Jupiter and
bigger. Kepler is designed to look for planets 30 to 600
times less massive, closer to the order of Earth’s mass
(Jupiter is 318 times more massive than Earth). The
method used, the transit method, involves observing repeated
transit of planets in front of their stars, which
causes a slight reduction in the star’s apparent magnitude,
on the order of 0.01% for an Earth-size planet. The degree
of this reduction in brightness can be used to deduce
the diameter of the planet, and the interval between
transits can be used to deduce the planet’s orbital period,
from which estimates of its orbital semi-major axis (using
Kepler’s laws) and its temperature (using models of
stellar radiation) can be calculated.
The probability of a random planetary orbit being along
the line-of-sight to a star is the diameter of the star divided
by the diameter of the orbit.[73] For an Earth-size
planet at 1 AU transiting a Sun-like star the probability is
0.47%, or about 1 in 210.[73] For a planet like Venus orbiting
a Sun-like star the probability is slightly higher, at
0.65%;[73] If the host star has multiple planets, the probability
of additional detections is higher than the probability
of initial detection assuming planets in a given system
tend to orbit in similar planes – an assumption consistent
with current models of planetary system formation.[73]
For instance, if a Kepler-like mission conducted by aliens
observed Earth transiting the Sun, there is a 12% chance
that it would also see Venus transiting.[73]
Kepler's 115 deg2 field of view gives it a much higher
probability of detecting Earth-sized planets than the
Hubble Space Telescope, which has a field of view of only
10 sq. arc-minutes. Moreover, Kepler is dedicated to detecting
planetary transits, while the Hubble Space Telescope
is used to address a wide range of scientific questions,
and rarely looks continuously at just one starfield.
Of the approximately half-million stars in Kepler's field
of view, around 150,000 stars were selected for observation.
More than 90,000 are G-type stars on, or near, the
main sequence. Thus, Kepler was designed to be sensitive
to wavelengths of 400–865 nm where brightness of
those stars peaks. Most of the stars observed by Kepler
have apparent visual magnitude between 14 and 16 but
the brightest observed stars have apparent visual magnitude
of 8 or lower. Most of the planet candidates were initially
not expected to be confirmed due to being too faint
for follow-up observations.[74] All the selected stars are
observed simultaneously, with the spacecraft measuring
variations in their brightness every thirty minutes. This
provides a better chance for seeing a transit. The mission
was designed to maximize the probability of detecting
planets orbiting other stars.[41][75]
Because Kepler must observe at least three transits to con-
firm that the dimming of a star was caused by a transiting
planet, and because larger planets give a signal that is easier
to check, scientists expected the first reported results
to be larger Jupiter-size planets in tight orbits. The first of
these were reported after only a few months of operation.
Smaller planets, and planets farther from their sun would
take longer, and discovering planets comparable to Earth
were expected to take three years or longer.[50]
Data collected by Kepler is also being used for studying
variable stars of various types and performing
asteroseismology,
[76] particularly on stars showing solarlike
oscillations.
[77]
4.2 Confirming planet candidates 7
4 Planet finding process
4.1 Finding planet candidates
Artist’s impression of Kepler
Once Kepler has collected and sent back the data, raw
light curves are constructed. Brightness values are then
adjusted to take the brightness variations due to the rotation
of the spacecraft into account. The next step is processing
(folding) light curves into a more easily observable
form and letting software select signals that seem potentially
transit-like. At this point, any signal that shows
potential transit-like features is called a threshold crossing
event. These signals are individually inspected in 2 inspection
rounds, with the first round taking only a few seconds
per target. This inspection eliminates erroneously
selected non-signals, signals caused by instrumental noise
and obvious eclipsing binaries.[78]
Threshold crossing events that pass these tests are called
Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI), receive a KOI designation
and are archived. KOIs are inspected more thoroughly
in a process called dispositioning. Those which
pass the dispositioning are called Kepler planet candidates.
The KOI archive is not static, meaning that a Kepler
candidate could end up in the false-positive list upon
further inspection. In turn, KOIs that were mistakenly
classified as false positives could end up back in the candidates
list.[79]
Not all the planet candidates go through this process.
Circumbinary planets do not show strictly periodic transits,
and have to be inspected through other methods.
In addition, third-party researchers use different dataprocessing
methods, or even search planet candidates
from the unprocessed light curve data. As a consequence,
those planets may be missing KOI designation.
4.2 Confirming planet candidates
Once suitable candidates have been found from Kepler
data, it is necessary to rule out false positives with followup
tests.
Usually, Kepler candidates are imaged individually with
more-advanced ground-based telescopes in order to resolve
any background objects which could contaminate
the brightness signature of the transit signal.[80] Another
method to rule out planet candidates is astrometry for
which Kepler can collect good data even though doing
so was not a design goal. While Kepler cannot detect
planetary-mass objects with this method, it can be used
to determine if the transit was caused by a stellar-mass
object.[81]
Kepler mission - new exoplanet candidates - as of July 23,
2015.[82]
4.2.1 Through other detection methods
There are a few different exoplanet detection methods
which help to rule out false positives by giving further
proof that a candidate is a real planet. One of the methods,
called doppler spectroscopy, requires follow-up observations
from ground-based telescopes. This method
works well if the planet is massive or is located around a
relatively bright star. While current spectrographs are insufficient
for confirming planetary candidates with small
masses around relatively dim stars, this method can be
used to discover additional massive non-transiting planet
candidates around targeted stars.
In multiplanetary systems, planets can often be confirmed
through transit timing variation by looking at the time between
successive transits, which may vary if planets are
gravitationally perturbed by each other. This helps to
confirm relatively low-mass planets even when the star is
relatively distant. Transit timing variations indicate that
two or more planets belong to the same planetary system.
There are even cases where a non-transiting planet is also
discovered in this way.[83]
Circumbinary planets show much larger transit timing
variations between transits than planets gravitationally
disturbed by other planets. Their transit duration times
also vary significantly. Transit timing and duration variations
for circumbinary planets are caused by the orbital
motion of the host stars, rather than by other planets.[84]
In addition, if the planet is massive enough, it can cause
slight variations of the host stars’ orbital periods. Despite
being harder to find circumbinary planets due to their
8 5 MISSION RESULTS TO DATE

non-periodic transits, it is much easier to confirm them,
as timing patterns of transits cannot be mimicked by an
eclipsing binary or a background star system.[85]
In addition to transits, planets orbiting around their stars
undergo reflected-light variations—like the Moon, they
go through phases from full to new and back again. Because
Kepler cannot resolve the planet from the star, it
sees only the combined light, and the brightness of the
host star seems to change over each orbit in a periodic
manner. Although the effect is small—the photometric
precision required to see a close-in giant planet is
about the same as to detect an Earth-sized planet in transit
across a solar-type star—Jupiter-sized planets with an
orbital period of a few days or less are detectable by sensitive
space telescopes such as Kepler. In the long run,
this method may help find more planets than the transit
method, because the reflected light variation with orbital
phase is largely independent of the planet’s orbital inclination,
and does not require the planet to pass in front of
the disk of the star. In addition, the phase function of
a giant planet is also a function of its thermal properties
and atmosphere, if any. Therefore, the phase curve may
constrain other planetary properties, such as the particle
size distribution of the atmospheric particles.[86]
Kepler's photometric precision is often high enough to observe
a star’s brightness changes caused by doppler beaming
or a star’s shape deformation by a companion. These
can sometimes be used to rule out hot Jupiter candidates
as false positives caused by a star or a brown dwarf
when these effects are too noticeable.[87] However, there
are some cases where such effects are detected even by
planetary-mass companions such as TrES-2b.
[88]
4.2.2 Through validation
If a planet cannot be detected through at least one of
the other detection methods, it can be confirmed by determining
if the possibility of a Kepler candidate being
a real planet is significantly larger than any falsepositive
scenarios combined. One of the first methods
was to see if other telescopes can see the transit as
well. The first planet confirmed through this method
was Kepler-22b which was also observed with a Spitzer
space telescope in addition to analyzing any other falsepositive
possibilities.[89] Such confirmation is costly, as
small planets can generally be detected only with space
telescopes.
In 2014, a new confirmation method called “validation
by multiplicity” was announced. From the planets previously
confirmed through various methods, it was found
that planets in most planetary systems orbit in a relatively
flat plane, similar to the planets found in the Solar System.
This means that if a star has multiple planet candidates,
it is very likely a real planetary system.[90] Transit
signals still need to meet several criteria which rule
out false-positive scenarios. For instance, it has to have
considerable signal-to-noise ratio, it has at least three observed
transits, orbital stability of those systems have to
be stable and transit curve has to have a shape that partly
eclipsing binaries could not mimic the transit signal. In
addition, its orbital period needs to be 1.6 days or longer
to rule out common false positives caused by eclipsing
binaries.[91] Validation by multiplicity method is very ef-
ficient and allows to confirm hundreds of Kepler candidates
in a relatively short amount of time.
A new validation method using a tool called PASTIS has
been developed. It makes it possible to confirm a planet
even when only a single candidate transit event for the
host star has been detected. A drawback of this tool is
that it requires a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio from
Kepler data, so it can mainly confirm only larger planets or
planets around quiet and relatively bright stars. Currently,
the analysis of Kepler candidates through this method is
underway.[92] PASTIS was first successful for validating
the planet Kepler-420b.[93]
5 Mission results to date
The Kepler observatory was in active operation from 2009
through 2013, with the first main results announced on
January 4, 2010. As expected, the initial discoveries were
all short-period planets. As the mission continued, additional
longer-period candidates were found.

this press conference, it was revealed that Kepler had con-
firmed the existence of the previously known transiting
exoplanet HAT-P-7b, and was functioning well enough
to discover Earth-size planets.[95][96]
Because Kepler's detection of planets depends on seeing
very small changes in brightness, stars that vary in brightness
by themselves (variable stars) are not useful in this
search.[66] From the first few months of data, Kepler scientists
determined that about 7,500 stars from the initial
target list are such variable stars. These were dropped
from the target list, and replaced by new candidates. On
November 4, 2009, the Kepler project publicly released
the light curves of the dropped stars.[97]
The first six weeks of data revealed five previously unknown
planets, all very close to their stars.[98][99] Among
the notable results are one of the least dense planets yet
found,[100] two low-mass white dwarfs[101] that were initially
reported as being members of a new class of stellar
objects,[102] and Kepler-16b, a well-characterized planet
orbiting a binary star.
5.2 2010
On June 15, 2010, the Kepler mission released data on
all but 400 of the ~156,000 planetary target stars to the
public. 706 targets from this first data set have viable exoplanet
candidates, with sizes ranging from as small as
Earth to larger than Jupiter. The identity and characteristics
of 306 of the 706 targets were given. The released
targets included five candidate multi-planet systems, including
six extra exoplanet candidates.[103] Only 33.5
days of data were available for most of the candidates.[103]
NASA also announced data for another 400 candidates
were being withheld to allow members of the Kepler team
to perform follow-up observations.[104] The data for these
candidates was published February 2, 2011.[105] (See the
Kepler results for 2011 below.)
The Kepler results, based on the candidates in the list released
in 2010, implied that most candidate planets have
radii less than half that of Jupiter. The results also imply
that small candidate planets with periods less than
thirty days are much more common than large candidate
planets with periods less than thirty days and that
the ground-based discoveries are sampling the large-size
tail of the size distribution.[103] This contradicted older
theories which had suggested small and Earth-size planets
would be relatively infrequent.[106][107] Based on extrapolations
from the Kepler data, an estimate of around
100 million habitable planets in the Milky Way may
be realistic.[108] Some media reports of the TED talk
have led to the misunderstanding that Kepler had actually
found these planets. This was clarified in a letter
to the Director of the NASA Ames Research Center,
for the Kepler Science Council dated August 2, 2010
states, “Analysis of the current Kepler data does not support
the assertion that Kepler has found any Earth-like
planets.”[6][109][110]
In 2010, Kepler identified two systems containing objects
which are smaller and hotter than their parent stars:
KOI 74 and KOI 81.
[111] These objects are probably lowmass
white dwarfs produced by previous episodes of mass
transfer in their systems.[101]
5.3 2011
On February 2, 2011, the Kepler team announced the results
of analysis of the data taken between 2 May and
September 16, 2009.[105] They found 1235 planetary candidates
circling 997 host stars. (The numbers that follow
10 5 MISSION RESULTS TO DATE
A size comparison of the exoplanets Kepler-20e[112] and Kepler-
20f[113] with Venus and Earth
assume the candidates are really planets, though the of-
ficial papers called them only candidates. Independent
analysis indicated that at least 90% of them are real planets
and not false positives).[114] 68 planets were approximately
Earth-size, 288 super-Earth-size, 662 Neptunesize,
165 Jupiter-size, and 19 up to twice the size of
Jupiter. In contrast to previous work, roughly 74% of the
planets are smaller than Neptune, most likely as a result
of previous work finding large planets more easily than
smaller ones.
That February 2, 2011 release of 1235 exoplanet candidates
included 54 that may be in the "habitable zone",
including five less than twice the size of Earth.[115][116]
There were previously only two planets thought to be
in the “habitable zone”, so these new findings represent
an enormous expansion of the potential number of
“Goldilocks planets” (planets of the right temperature to
support liquid water).[117] All of the habitable zone candidates
found thus far orbit stars significantly smaller and
cooler than the Sun (habitable candidates around Sun-like
stars will take several additional years to accumulate the
three transits required for detection).[118] Of all the new
planet candidates, 68 are 125% of Earth's size or smaller,
or smaller than all previously discovered exoplanets.[116]
“Earth-size” and “super-Earth-size” is defined as “less
than or equal to 2 Earth radii (Re)" [(or, Rp ≤ 2.0
Re) – Table 5].[105] Six such planet candidates [namely:
KOI 326.01 (Rp=0.85), KOI 701.03 (Rp=1.73), KOI
268.01 (Rp=1.75), KOI 1026.01 (Rp=1.77), KOI 854.01
(Rp=1.91), KOI 70.03 (Rp=1.96) – Table 6][105] are in
the “habitable zone.”[115] A more recent study found that
one of these candidates (KOI 326.01) is in fact much
larger and hotter than first reported.[119]
The frequency of planet observations was highest for exoplanets
two to three times Earth-size, and then declined in
inverse proportionality to the area of the planet. The best
estimate (as of March 2011), after accounting for observational
biases, was: 5.4% of stars host Earth-size candidates,
6.8% host super-Earth-size candidates, 19.3%
host Neptune-size candidates, and 2.55% host Jupitersize
or larger candidates. Multi-planet systems are common;
17% of the host stars have multi-candidate systems,
and 33.9% of all the planets are in multiple planet
systems.[120]
By December 5, 2011, the Kepler team announced that
they had discovered 2,326 planetary candidates, of which
207 are similar in size to Earth, 680 are super-Earth-size,
1,181 are Neptune-size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are
larger than Jupiter. Compared to the February 2011 figures,
the number of Earth-size and super-Earth-size planets
increased by 200% and 140% respectively. Moreover,
48 planet candidates were found in the habitable zones of
surveyed stars, marking a decrease from the February figure;
this was due to the more stringent criteria in use in
the December data.[121]
On December 20, 2011, the Kepler team announced
the discovery of the first Earth-size exoplanets, Kepler-
20e[112] and Kepler-20f,
[113] orbiting a Sun-like star,
Kepler-20.
[122]
Based on Kepler's findings, astronomer Seth Shostak estimated
in 2011 that “within a thousand light-years of
Earth”, there are “at least 30,000” habitable planets.[123]
Also based on the findings, the Kepler team has estimated
that there are “at least 50 billion planets in the Milky
Way”, of which “at least 500 million” are in the habitable
zone.
[124] In March 2011, astronomers at NASA’s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) reported that about “1.4 to
2.7 percent” of all Sun-like stars are expected to have
Earth-size planets “within the habitable zones of their
stars”. This means there are “two billion” of these “Earth
analogs” in the Milky Way alone. The JPL astronomers
also noted that there are “50 billion other galaxies”, potentially
yielding more than one sextillion “Earth analog”
planets if all galaxies have similar numbers of planets to
the Milky Way.[125]
5.4 2012
In January 2012, an international team of astronomers reported
that each star in the Milky Way may host "on average...at
least 1.6 planets", suggesting that over 160 billion
star-bound planets may exist in the Milky Way.[126][127]
Kepler also recorded distant stellar super-flares, some of
which are 10,000 times more powerful than the superlative
1859 Carrington event.
[128] The superflares may be
triggered by close-orbiting Jupiter-sized planets.[128] The
Transit Timing Variation (TTV) technique, which was
used to discover Kepler-9d, gained popularity for con-
firming exoplanet discoveries.[129] A planet in a system
with four stars was also confirmed, the first time such a
system had been discovered.[130]
As of 2012, there were a total of 2,321 candidates.
[121][131][132] Of these, 207 are similar in size to
Earth, 680 are super-Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune-size,
203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. Moreover,
48 planet candidates were found in the habitable
zones of surveyed stars. The Kepler team estimated that
5.6 2014 11
5.4% of all stars host Earth-size planet candidates, and
that 17% of all stars have multiple planets.
5.5 2013
A chart showing Kepler discoveries, in context of all discovered
exoplanets (through 2013), with some transit probabilities indicated
for example scenarios.
According to a study by Caltech astronomers published
in January 2013, the Milky Way contains at least as
many planets as it does stars, resulting in 100–400 billion
exoplanets.
[133][134] The study, based on planets orbiting
the star Kepler-32, suggests that planetary systems may
be common around stars in the Milky Way. The discovery
of 461 more candidates was announced on January
7, 2013.[135] The longer Kepler watches, the more planets
with long periods it can detect.[135]
A candidate, newly announced on January 7, 2013, was
Kepler-69c (formerly, KOI-172.02), an Earth-size exoplanet
orbiting a star similar to the Sun in the habitable
zone and possibly habitable.[136]
In April 2013, a white dwarf was discovered bending
the light of its companion red dwarf in the KOI-256 star
system.[137]
In April 2013, NASA announced the discovery of three
new Earth-size exoplanets – Kepler-62e, Kepler-62f, and
Kepler-69c – in the habitable zones of their respective
host stars, Kepler-62 and Kepler-69. The new exoplanets
are considered prime candidates for possessing liquid water
and thus a habitable environment.[138][139][140] A more
recent analysis has shown that Kepler-69c is likely more
analogous to Venus, and thus unlikely to be habitable.[141]
On May 15, 2013, NASA announced the spacecraft had
been crippled by failure of a reaction wheel that keeps it
pointed in the right direction. A second wheel had previously
failed, and the spacecraft requires three wheels
(out of four total) to be operational for the instrument to
function properly. Further testing in July and August determined
that while Kepler was capable of using its damaged
reaction wheels to prevent itself from entering safe
mode and downlinking previously collected science data
it was not capable of collecting further science data as
previously configured.[142] Scientists working on the Kepler
project said there was a backlog of data still to be
looked at, and that more discoveries would be made in
the following couple of years, despite the setback.[143]
Although no new science data from Kepler field had been
collected since the problem, an additional sixty-three candidates
were announced in July 2013 based on the previously
collected observations.[144]
In November 2013, the second Kepler science conference
was held. The discoveries included the median size of
planet candidates getting smaller compared to early 2013,
preliminary results of the discovery of a few circumbinary
planets and planets in the habitable zone.[145]
5.6 2014
Histogram of exoplanet discoveries. The yellow shaded bar
shows newly announced planets including those verified by the
multiplicity technique (February 26, 2014).
On February 13, over 530 additional planet candidates
were announced residing around single planet systems.
Several of them were nearly Earth-sized and located in
the habitable zone. This number was further increased
by about 400 in June 2014.[146]
On February 26, scientists announced that data from Kepler
had confirmed the existence of 715 new exoplanets.
A new statistical method of confirmation was used
called “verification by multiplicity” which is based on
how many planets around multiple stars were found to
be real planets. This allowed much quicker confirmation
of numerous candidates which are part of multiplanetary
systems. 95% of the discovered exoplanets were
smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f,
were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable
zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid
12 5 MISSION RESULTS TO DATE
water.
[90][147][148][149]
In March, a study found that small planets with orbital
periods of less than 1 day are usually accompanied by
at least one additional planet with orbital period of 1–50
days. This study also noted that ultra-short period planets
are almost always smaller than 2 Earth radii unless it is a
misaligned hot Jupiter.[150]
Kepler data has also helped scientists observe and understand
supernovae; measurements were collected every
half-hour so the light curves were especially useful for
studying these types of astronomical events.[151]
On April 17, the Kepler team announced the discovery of
Kepler-186f, the first nearly Earth-sized planet located
in the habitable zone. This planet orbits around a red
dwarf.[152]
In May 2014, K2 campaign fields 0 to 13 were announced
and described in detail.[153]
In July 2014, the first discoveries from post-Kepler field
data were reported in the form of eclipsing binaries. Discoveries
were derived from a Kepler engineering data set
which was collected prior to campaign 0[154] in preparation
to the main K2 mission.[155]
On September 23, 2014, NASA reported that the K2
mission had completed campaign 1,[156] the first official
set of science observations, and that campaign 2[157] was
underway.[158]
Kepler observed KSN 2011b, a Type Ia supernova, in the process
of exploding: before, during and after.[159]
Campaign 3[160] lasted from November 14, 2014 to
February 6, 2015 and included “16,375 standard long cadence
and 55 standard short cadence targets”.[153]
5.7 2015
• In January 2015, the number of confirmed Kepler
planets exceeded 1000. At least two (Kepler-
438b and Kepler-442b) of the discovered planets
announced that month were likely rocky and in the
habitable zone.
[33] Also in January 2015, NASA
reported that five confirmed sub-earth-sized rocky
exoplanets, all smaller than the planet Venus, were
found orbiting the 11.2 billion year old star Kepler-
444, making this star system, at 80% of the age of
the universe, the oldest yet discovered.[161][162][163]
• In April 2015, campaign 4[164] was reported to last
between February 7, 2015, and April 24, 2015,
and to include observations of nearly 16,000 target
stars and two notable open star clusters, Pleiades and
Hyades.[165]
• In May 2015, Kepler observed a newly discovered
supernova, KSN 2011b (Type 1a), before, during
and after explosion. Details of the pre-nova moments
may help scientists better understand dark energy.
[159]
• On July 24, 2015, NASA announced the discovery
of Kepler-452b, a confirmed exoplanet that is nearEarth
in size and found orbiting the habitable zone
of a Sun-like star.[166][167] The seventh Kepler planet
candidate catalog was released, containing 4,696
candidates, and increase of 521 candidates since the
previous catalog release in January 2015.[168][169]
• On September 14, 2015, astronomers reported
unusual light fluctuations of KIC 8462852, an
F-type main-sequence star in the constellation
Cygnus, as detected by Kepler, while searching for
exoplanets. Various hypotheses have been presented,
including comets, asteroids, and an alien civilization.
[170][171][172]
5.8 2016
• On May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler
mission had verified 1,284 new planets.[34] Based on
their size, about 550 could be rocky planets. Nine
of these orbit in their stars’ habitable zone:
[34]
• Kepler-1638b
• Kepler-1606b
• Kepler-1544b
• Kepler-1410b
• Kepler-1455b
• Kepler-560b
• Kepler-705b
• Kepler-1593b
• Kepler-1229b
Of the nearly 5,000 total planet candidates found to date,
more than 3,200 now have been verified, and 2,325 of
these were discovered by Kepler.
[34]
6.3 Second Light (K2) 13
6 Mission status
Kepler was launched in 2009. It was very successful at
finding exoplanets, but failures in two of four reaction
wheels crippled its extended mission in 2013. Without
three functioning wheels, the telescope could not be
pointed accurately.
6.1 Extension
Predicted structure of the Milky Way overlaid with the original
Kepler search space.[5]
In April 2012, an independent panel of senior NASA scientists
recommended that the Kepler mission be continued
through 2016. According to the senior review, Kepler
observations needed to continue until at least 2015
to achieve all the stated scientific goals.[173] On November
14, 2012, NASA announced the completion of Kepler's
primary mission, and the beginning of its extended
mission, which may last as long as four years.[174]
6.2 Reaction wheel issues
In July 2012, one of Kepler's four reaction wheels (wheel
2) failed.[17] On May 11, 2013, a second wheel (wheel
4) failed, jeopardizing the continuation of the mission, as
three wheels are necessary for its planet hunting.[15][16]
Kepler had not collected science data since May because
it was not able to point with sufficient accuracy.[135] On
July 18 and 22 reaction wheels 4 and 2 were tested respectively;
wheel 4 only rotated counter-clockwise but
wheel 2 ran in both directions, albeit with significantly
elevated friction levels.[175] A further test of wheel 4 on
July 25 managed to achieve bi-directional rotation.[176]
Both wheels, however, exhibited too much friction to be
useful.[19] On August 2, NASA put out a call for proposals
to use the remaining capabilities of Kepler for other
scientific missions. Starting on August 8, a full systems
evaluation was conducted. It was determined that wheel
2 could not provide sufficient precision for scientific missions
and the spacecraft was returned to a “rest” state to
conserve fuel.[17] Wheel 4 was previously ruled out because
it exhibited higher friction levels than wheel 2 in
previous tests.[176] Sending astronauts to fix Kepler is not
an option because it orbits the Sun and is millions of kilometers
from Earth.[19]
On August 15, 2013, NASA announced that Kepler
would not continue searching for planets using the transit
method after attempts to resolve issues with two of the
four reaction wheels failed.[17][18][19] An engineering report
was ordered to assess the spacecraft’s capabilities,
its two good reaction wheels and its thrusters.[17] Concurrently,
a scientific study was conducted to determine
whether enough knowledge can be obtained from Kepler's
limited scope to justify its $18 million per year cost.
Possible future uses include searching for asteroids and
comets, looking for evidence of supernovas, and finding
huge exoplanets through gravitational microlensing.
[19]
Another proposal is to modify the software on Kepler to
compensate for the disabled reaction wheels. Instead of
the stars being fixed and stable in Kepler's field of view,
they will drift. However, software could track this drift
and more or less completely recover the mission goals despite
being unable to hold the stars in a fixed view.[177]
Previously collected data continues to be analyzed.[178]
6.3 Second Light (K2)
In November 2013, a new mission plan named K2 “Second
Light” was presented for consideration.[22][23][24][179]
K2 would involve using Kepler's remaining capability,
photometric precision of about 300 parts per million,
compared with about 20 parts per million earlier, to collect
data for the study of "supernova explosions, star
formation and Solar-System bodies such as asteroids
and comets, ... " and for finding and studying more
exoplanets.
[22][23][179] In this proposed mission plan, Kepler
would search a much larger area in the plane of
Earth’s orbit around the Sun.
[22][23][179]
14 6 MISSION STATUS
K2
proposal explained (December 11, 2013).[23]
In early 2014, the spacecraft underwent successful testing
for the K2 mission.[180] From March to May 2014,
data from a new field called Field 0 was collected as a
testing run.[181] On May 16, 2014, NASA announced
the approval of extending the Kepler mission to the K2
mission.[25] Kepler's photometric precision for the K2
mission was estimated to be 50 ppm on a magnitude
12 star for a 6.5-hour integration.[182] In February 2014,
photometric precision for the K2 mission using twowheel,
fine-point precision operations was measured as
44 ppm on magnitude 12 stars for a 6.5-hour integration.
The analysis of these measurements by NASA suggests
the K2 photometric precision approaches that of the Kepler
archive of three-wheel, fine-point precision data.[183]
K2
mission timeline (August 8, 2014).[184]
On May 29, 2014, campaign fields 0 to 13 were reported
and described in detail.[153]
Field 1 of the K2 mission is set towards the Leo-Virgo region
of the sky, while Field 2 is towards the “head” area
of Scorpius and includes two globular clusters, Messier 4
and Messier 80,
[185] and part of the Scorpius–Centaurus
Association, which is only about 11 million years old[186]
and 120–140 parsecs (380–470 ly) distant[187] with probably
over 1,000 members.[188]
On December 18, 2014, NASA announced that the K2
mission had detected its first confirmed exoplanet, a
super-Earth named HIP 116454 b. Its signature was
found in a set of engineering data meant to prepare the
spacecraft for the full K2 mission. Radial velocity followup
observations were needed as only a single transit of the
planet was detected.[189]
During a scheduled contact on April 7, 2016, Kepler
was found to be operating in emergency mode, the lowest
operational and most fuel intensive mode. Mission
operations declared a spacecraft emergency, which afforded
them priority access to NASA’s Deep Space Network.
[190][191] By the evening of April 8 the spacecraft
had been upgraded to safe mode, and on April 10 it
was placed into point-rest state,[192] a stable mode which
provides normal communication and the lowest fuel
burn.[190] At that time, the cause of the emergency was
unknown, but it was not believed that Kepler's reaction
wheels or a planned maneuver to support K2's Campaign
9 were responsible. Operators downloaded and analyzed
engineering data from the spacecraft, with the prioritization
of returning to normal science operations.[190][193]
Kepler was returned to science mode on April 22.[194]
The emergency caused the first half of Campaign 9 to
be shortened by two weeks.[195]
In June 2016, NASA announced a K2 mission extension
of three additional years, beyond the expected exhaustion
of on-board fuel in 2018.[196]
15
7 Data releases
The Kepler team originally promised to release data
within one year of observations.[197] However, this plan
was changed after launch, with data being scheduled for
release up to three years after its collection.[198] This resulted
in considerable criticism,[199][200][201][202][203] leading
the Kepler science team to release the third quarter of
their data one year and nine months after collection.[204]
The data through September 2010 (quarters 4, 5, and 6)
was made public in January 2012.[205]
7.1 Follow-ups by others
Periodically, the Kepler team releases a list of candidates
(Kepler Objects of Interest, or KOIs) to the public. Using
this information, a team of astronomers collected
radial velocity data using the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph
to confirm the existence of the candidate KOI-
428b in 2010, later named Kepler-40b.
[206] In 2011, the
same team confirmed candidate KOI-423b, later named
Kepler-39b.
[207]
7.2 Citizen scientist participation
Since December 2010, Kepler mission data has been used
for the Zooniverse project “Planethunters.org”, which allows
volunteers to look for transit events in the light
curves of Kepler images to identify planets that computer
algorithms might miss.[208] By June 2011, users had
found sixty-nine potential candidates that were previously
unrecognized by the Kepler mission team.[209] The team
has plans to publicly credit amateurs who spot such planets.
In January 2012, the BBC program Stargazing Live
aired a public appeal for volunteers to analyse Planethunters.org
data for potential new exoplanets. This
led two amateur astronomers—one in Peterborough,
England—to discover a new Neptune-sized exoplanet, to
be named Threapleton Holmes B.[210] One hundred thousand
other volunteers were also engaged in the search by
late January, analyzing over one million Kepler images
by early 2012.[211] One such exoplanet, PH1b (or Kepler-
64b from its Kepler designation), was discovered in 2012.
A second exoplanet, PH2b (Kepler-86b) was discovered
in 2013.
In April 2017, ABC Stargazing Live, a variation of BBC
Stargazing Live, launched the Zooniverse project “Exoplanet
Explorers”. While Planethunters.org worked with
archived data, Exoplanet Explorers used recently downlinked
data from the K2 mission. On the first day of
the project, 184 transit candidates were identified that
passed simple tests. On the second day, the research
team identified a star system with a Sun-like star and
four super-Earths in a tight orbit. In the end, volunteers
helped to identify 90 exoplanet candidates.[212][213] The
citizen scientists that helped discover the new star system
will be added as co-authors in the research paper when
published.[214]
8 Confirmed exoplanets
Confirmed small exoplanets in habitable zones (Kepler-62e,
Kepler-62f, Kepler-186f, Kepler-296e, Kepler-296f,
Kepler-438b, Kepler-440b, Kepler-442b).[33]
