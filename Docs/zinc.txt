Zinc
This article is about the metallic element. For other uses,
see Zinc (disambiguation).
Zinc is a chemical element with the symbol Zn and
atomic number 30. It is the first element in group 12
of the periodic table. In some respects zinc is chemically
similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only
one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+
ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant
element in Earth’s crust and has five stable isotopes. The
most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc
sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia,
Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth
flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using
electricity (electrowinning).
Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions,
was used as early as the third millennium BC in
the Aegean, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kalmykia,
Turkmenistan and Georgia, and the second millennium
BC in West India, Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and
Israel[3] (Judea[4]).[5] Zinc metal was not produced on
a large scale until the 12th century in India and was
unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century.
The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of
zinc production going back to the 6th century BC.[6] To
date, the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar,
in Rajasthan, as early as the 9th century AD when
a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc.[7]
Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called
"philosopher’s wool" or “white snow”.
The element was probably named by the alchemist
Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth).
German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited
with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work
by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the
electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosionresistant
zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the
major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical
batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys
such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly
used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate
(as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants),
zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in
luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the
organic laboratory.
Zinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today
as being of “exceptional biologic and public health
importance”, especially regarding prenatal and postnatal
development.[8] Zinc deficiency affects about two billion
people in the developing world and is associated with
many diseases.[9] In children, deficiency causes growth
retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility,
and diarrhea.[8] Enzymes with a zinc atom in the
reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as
alcohol dehydrogenase in humans.[10] Consumption of
excess zinc can cause ataxia, lethargy and copper deficiency.
1 Characteristics
1.1 Physical properties
Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, diamagnetic metal,[11]
though most common commercial grades of the metal
have a dull finish.[12] It is somewhat less dense than iron
and has a hexagonal crystal structure, with a distorted
form of hexagonal close packing, in which each atom has
six nearest neighbors (at 265.9 pm) in its own plane and
six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm.[13] The metal
is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable
between 100 and 150 °C.[11][12] Above 210 °C,
the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by
beating.[14] Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity.[11] For
a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5 °C) and
boiling points (907 °C).[15] The melting point is the lowest
of all the transition metals aside from mercury and
cadmium.[15]
Many alloys contain zinc, including brass. Other metals
long known to form binary alloys with zinc are
aluminium, antimony, bismuth, gold, iron, lead, mercury,
silver, tin, magnesium, cobalt, nickel, tellurium, and
sodium.[16] Although neither zinc nor zirconium are
ferromagnetic, their alloy ZrZn
2 exhibits ferromagnetism below 35 K.[11]
A bar of zinc generates a characteristic sound when bent,
similar to tin cry.
1.2 Occurrence
See also: Zinc minerals
Zinc makes up about 75 ppm (0.0075%) of Earth’s crust,
making it the 24th most abundant element. Soil contains
zinc in 5–770 ppm with an average 64 ppm. Seawater has
only 30 ppb and the atmosphere, 0.1–4 μg/m3.[17]

2 1 CHARACTERISTICS
Sphalerite (ZnS)
The element is normally found in association with other
base metals such as copper and lead in ores.[18] Zinc is
a chalcophile, meaning the element has a low affinity for
oxides and prefers to bond with sulfides. Chalcophiles
formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions
of the early Earth’s atmosphere.[19] Sphalerite,
which is a form of zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined
zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–
62% zinc.[18]
Other source minerals for zinc include smithsonite (zinc
carbonate), hemimorphite (zinc silicate), wurtzite (another
zinc sulfide), and sometimes hydrozincite (basic
zinc carbonate).[20] With the exception of wurtzite, all
these other minerals were formed by weathering of the
primordial zinc sulfides.[19]
Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9–2.8 billion
tonnes.[21][22] Large deposits are in Australia, Canada
and the United States, with the largest reserves in
Iran.[19][23][24] The most recent estimate of reserve base
for zinc (meets specified minimum physical criteria related
to current mining and production practices) was
made in 2009 and calculated to be roughly 480 Mt.[25]
Zinc reserves, on the other hand, are geologically identified
ore bodies whose suitability for recovery is economically
based (location, grade, quality, and quantity) at the
time of determination. Since exploration and mine development
is an ongoing process, the amount of zinc reserves
is not a fixed number and sustainability of zinc ore supplies
cannot be judged by simply extrapolating the combined
mine life of today’s zinc mines. This concept is well
supported by data from the United States Geological Survey
(USGS), which illustrates that although refined zinc
production increased 80% between 1990 and 2010, the
reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged. About
346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history
to 2002, and scholars have estimated that about 109–
305 million tonnes are in use.[26][27][28]
1.3 Isotopes
Main article: Isotopes of zinc
Five isotopes of zinc occur in nature. 64Zn is the most
abundant isotope (48.63% natural abundance).[29] That
isotope has such a long half-life, at 4.3×1018 a,[30] that
its radioactivity can be ignored.[31] Similarly, 70
Zn (0.6%), with a half-life of 1.3×1016 a is not usually
considered to be radioactive. The other isotopes found in
nature are 66
Zn (28%), 67
Zn (4%) and 68
Zn (19%).
Several dozen radioisotopes have been characterized. 65
Zn, which has a half-life of 243.66 days, is the least active
radioisotope, followed by 72
Zn with a half-life of 46.5 hours.[29] Zinc has 10 nuclear
isomers. 69mZn has the longest half-life, 13.76 h.[29] The
superscript m indicates a metastable isotope. The nucleus
of a metastable isotope is in an excited state and will return
to the ground state by emitting a photon in the form
of a gamma ray. 61
Zn has three excited states and 73
Zn has two.[32] The isotopes 65
Zn, 71
Zn, 77
Zn and 78
Zn each have only one excited state.[29]
The most common decay mode of a radioisotope of zinc
with a mass number lower than 66 is electron capture.
The decay product resulting from electron capture is an
isotope of copper.[29]

2.2 Zinc(I) compounds 3
2 Compounds and chemistry
Main article: Compounds of zinc
2.1 Reactivity
See also: Clemmensen reduction
Zinc has an electron configuration of [Ar]3d104s2 and is
a member of the group 12 of the periodic table. It is a
moderately reactive metal and strong reducing agent.[33]
The surface of the pure metal tarnishes quickly, eventually
forming a protective passivating layer of the basic
zinc carbonate, Zn
5(OH)
6(CO3)
2, by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide.[34] This
layer helps prevent further reaction with air and water.
Zinc burns in air with a bright bluish-green flame, giving
off fumes of zinc oxide.[35] Zinc reacts readily with
acids, alkalis and other non-metals.[36] Extremely pure
zinc reacts only slowly at room temperature with acids.[35]
Strong acids, such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, can remove
the passivating layer and subsequent reaction with
water releases hydrogen gas.[35]
The chemistry of zinc is dominated by the +2 oxidation
state. When compounds in this oxidation state are
formed, the outer shell s electrons are lost, yielding a bare
zinc ion with the electronic configuration [Ar]3d10.[37] In
aqueous solution an octahedral complex, [Zn(H
2O)6]2+
is the predominant species.[38] The volatilization of zinc
in combination with zinc chloride at temperatures above
285 °C indicates the formation of Zn
2Cl
2, a zinc compound with a +1 oxidation state.[35] No compounds
of zinc in oxidation states other than +1 or +2
are known.[39] Calculations indicate that a zinc compound
with the oxidation state of +4 is unlikely to exist.[40]
Zinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late
first-row transition metals, nickel and copper, though it
has a filled d-shell and compounds are diamagnetic and
mostly colorless.[41] The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium
happen to be nearly identical. Because of this
some of the equivalent salts have the same crystal structure,[
42] and in other circumstances where ionic radius is
a determining factor, the chemistry of zinc has much in
common with that of magnesium.[35] In other respects,
there is little similarity with the late first-row transition
metals. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree
of covalency and much more stable complexes with
N- and S- donors.[41] Complexes of zinc are mostly 4-
or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are
known.[35]
2.2 Zinc(I) compounds
Zinc(I) compounds are rare and need bulky ligands to stabilize
the low oxidation state. Most zinc(I) compounds
contain formally the [Zn2]2+ core, which is analogous to
the [Hg2]2+ dimeric cation present in mercury(I) compounds.
The diamagnetic nature of the ion confirms its
dimeric structure. The first zinc(I) compound containing
the Zn–Zn bond, (η5-C5Me5)2Zn2, is also the first
dimetallocene. The [Zn2]2+ ion rapidly disproportionates
into zinc metal and zinc(II), and has been obtained only
a yellow glass only by cooling a solution of metallic zinc
in molten ZnCl2.[43]
2.3 Zinc(II) compounds
Zinc acetate
Zinc chloride
Binary compounds of zinc are known for most of the
metalloids and all the nonmetals except the noble gases.
The oxide ZnO is a white powder that is nearly insoluble
in neutral aqueous solutions, but is amphoteric, dissolving
in both strong basic and acidic solutions.[35] The other
chalcogenides (ZnS, ZnSe, and ZnTe) have varied applications
in electronics and optics.[44] Pnictogenides (Zn

2 has the most ionic character, while the others (ZnCl
2, ZnBr
2, and ZnI
2) have relatively low melting points and are considered
to have more covalent character.[48]
In weak basic solutions containing Zn2+
ions, the hydroxide Zn(OH)
2 forms as a white precipitate. In stronger alkaline
solutions, this hydroxide is dissolved to form zincates
([Zn(OH)4]2−
).[35] The nitrate Zn(NO3)

2O and the chromate ZnCrO
4 (one of the few colored zinc compounds) are a few
examples of other common inorganic compounds of
zinc.[49][50] One of the simplest examples of an organic
compound of zinc is the acetate (Zn(O
2CCH3)
2).
Organozinc compounds are those that contain zinc–
carbon covalent bonds. Diethylzinc ((C
2H5)
2Zn) is a reagent in synthetic chemistry. It was first reported
in 1848 from the reaction of zinc and ethyl iodide,
and was the first compound known to contain a metal–
carbon sigma bond.[51]
2.4 Test for zinc
Cobalticyanide paper (Rinnmann’s test for Zn) can be
used as a chemical indicator for zinc. 4 g of K3Co(CN)6
and 1 g of KClO3 is dissolved on 100 ml of water. Paper
is dipped in the solution and dried at 100 °C. One drop
of the sample is dropped onto the dry paper and heated.
A green disc indicates the presence of zinc.[52]
3 History
3.1 Ancient use
Late Roman brass bucket – the Hemmoorer Eimer from
Warstade, Germany, second to third century AD
Various isolated examples of the use of impure zinc in ancient
times have been discovered. Zinc ores were used to
make the zinc–copper alloy brass thousands of years prior
to the discovery of zinc as a separate element. Judean
brass from the 14th to 10th centuries BC contains 23%
zinc.[4]
Knowledge of how to produce brass spread to Ancient
Greece by the 7th century BC, but few varieties were
made.[5] Ornaments made of alloys containing 80–90%
zinc, with lead, iron, antimony, and other metals making
up the remainder, have been found that are 2,500 years
old.[18] A possibly prehistoric statuette containing 87.5%
zinc was found in a Dacian archaeological site.[53]
The oldest known pills were made of the zinc carbonates
hydrozincite and smithsonite. The pills were used for sore
eyes and were found aboard the Roman ship Relitto del
Pozzino, wrecked in 140 BC.[54][55]
The manufacture of brass was known to the Romans by
about 30 BC.[56] They made brass by heating powdered
calamine (zinc silicate or carbonate), charcoal and copper
together in a crucible.[56] The resulting calamine brass
was then either cast or hammered into shape for use in
weaponry.[57] Some coins struck by Romans in the Christian
era are made of what is probably calamine brass.[58]
Strabo writing in the 1st century BC (but quoting a now
lost work of the 4th century BC historian Theopompus)
mentions “drops of false silver” which when mixed with
copper make brass. This may refer to small quantities of
zinc that is a by-product of smelting sulfide ores.[59] Zinc
3.3 Isolation 5
in such remnants in smelting ovens was usually discarded
as it was thought to be worthless.[60]
The Berne zinc tablet is a votive plaque dating to Roman
Gaul made of an alloy that is mostly zinc.[61]
The Charaka Samhita, thought to have been written between
300 and 500 AD,[62] mentions a metal which,
when oxidized, produces pushpanjan, thought to be zinc
oxide.[63] Zinc mines at Zawar, near Udaipur in India,
have been active since the Mauryan period. The smelting
of metallic zinc here, however, appears to have begun
around the 12th century AD.[64][65] One estimate is
that this location produced an estimated million tonnes
of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th
centuries.[20] Another estimate gives a total production
of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period.[64] The
Rasaratna Samuccaya, written in approximately the 13th
century AD, mentions two types of zinc-containing ores:
one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal
purposes.[65]
3.2 Early studies and naming
Zinc was distinctly recognized as a metal under the designation
of Yasada or Jasada in the medical Lexicon ascribed
to the Hindu king Madanapala (of Taka dynasty)
and written about the year 1374.[66] Smelting and extraction
of impure zinc by reducing calamine with wool and
other organic substances was accomplished in the 13th
century in India.[11][67] The Chinese did not learn of the
technique until the 17th century.[67]
Various alchemical symbols for the element zinc
Alchemists burned zinc metal in air and collected the resulting
zinc oxide on a condenser. Some alchemists called
this zinc oxide lana philosophica, Latin for “philosopher’s
wool”, because it collected in wooly tufts, whereas others
thought it looked like white snow and named it nix album.[
68]
The name of the metal was probably first documented
by Paracelsus, a Swiss-born German alchemist, who referred
to the metal as “zincum” or “zinken” in his book
Liber Mineralium II, in the 16th century.[67][69] The word
is probably derived from the German zinke, and supposedly
meant “tooth-like, pointed or jagged” (metallic zinc
crystals have a needle-like appearance).[70] Zink could
also imply “tin-like” because of its relation to German
zinn meaning tin.[71] Yet another possibility is that the
word is derived from the Persian word سنگ seng meaning
stone.[72] The metal was also called Indian tin, tutanego,
calamine, and spinter.[18]
German metallurgist Andreas Libavius received a quantity
of what he called “calay” of Malabar from a cargo
ship captured from the Portuguese in 1596.[73] Libavius
described the properties of the sample, which may have
been zinc. Zinc was regularly imported to Europe from
the Orient in the 17th and early 18th centuries,[67] but was
at times very expensive.[note 1]
3.3 Isolation
Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is given credit for first isolating
pure zinc
Metallic zinc was isolated in India by 1300 AD,[74][75][76]
much earlier than in the West. Before it was isolated
in Europe, it was imported from India in about 1600
CE.[77] Postlewayt’s Universal Dictionary, a contemporary
source giving technological information in Europe,
did not mention zinc before 1751 but the element was
studied before then.[65][78]
Flemish metallurgist and alchemist P. M. de Respour reported
that he had extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide
in 1668.[20] By the start of the 18th century, Étienne
François Geoffroy described how zinc oxide condenses
as yellow crystals on bars of iron placed above zinc ore
that is being smelted.[20] In Britain, John Lane is said to
have carried out experiments to smelt zinc, probably at
Landore, prior to his bankruptcy in 1726.[79]
In 1738 in Great Britain, William Champion patented a
process to extract zinc from calamine in a vertical retort
style smelter.[80] His technique resembled that used at Za6
4 PRODUCTION
war zinc mines in Rajasthan, but no evidence suggests
he visited the Orient.[77] Champion’s process was used
through 1851.[67]
German chemist Andreas Marggraf normally gets credit
for discovering pure metallic zinc, even though Swedish
chemist Anton von Swab had distilled zinc from
calamine four years previously.[67] In his 1746 experiment,
Marggraf heated a mixture of calamine and
charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a
metal.[60] This procedure became commercially practical
by 1752.[81]
3.4 Later work
Galvanization was named after Luigi Galvani.
William Champion’s brother, John, patented a process in
1758 for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the
retort process.[18] Prior to this, only calamine could be
used to produce zinc. In 1798, Johann Christian Ruberg
improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal
retort smelter.[82] Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built
a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium that
processed even more zinc.[67] Italian doctor Luigi Galvani
discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord
of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a
brass hook caused the frog’s leg to twitch.[83] He incorrectly
thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and
muscles to create electricity and called the effect "animal
electricity".[84] The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization
were both named for Luigi Galvani, and his
discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries, galvanization,
and cathodic protection.[84]
Galvani’s friend, Alessandro Volta, continued researching
the effect and invented the Voltaic pile in 1800.[83]
The basic unit of Volta’s pile was a simplified galvanic
cell, made of plates of copper and zinc separated by
an electrolyte and connected by a conductor externally.
The units were stacked in series to make the Voltaic cell,
which produced electricity by directing electrons from the
zinc to the copper and allowing the zinc to corrode.[83]
The non-magnetic character of zinc and its lack of color
in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry
and nutrition.[85] This changed in 1940 when
carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide
from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active
site.[85] The digestive enzyme carboxypeptidase became
the second known zinc-containing enzyme in 1955.[85]

of about 13 million tonnes.[21] The world’s largest
4.2 Environmental impact 7
zinc producer is Nyrstar, a merger of the Australian OZ
Minerals and the Belgian Umicore.[87] About 70% of the
world’s zinc originates from mining, while the remaining
30% comes from recycling secondary zinc.[88] Commercially
pure zinc is known as Special High Grade, often
abbreviated SHG, and is 99.995% pure.[89]
Worldwide, 95% of new zinc is mined from sulfidic ore
deposits, in which sphalerite (ZnS) is nearly always mixed
with the sulfides of copper, lead and iron.[90] Zinc mines
are scattered throughout the world, with the main areas
being China, Australia, and Peru. China produced 38%
of the global zinc output in 2014.[21]
Zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy.[91]
The ore is finely ground, then put through froth flotation
to separate minerals from gangue (on the property of
hydrophobicity), to get a zinc sulfide ore concentrate[91]
consisting of about 50% zinc, 32% sulfur, 13% iron, and
5% SiO
2.[91]
Roasting converts the zinc sulfide concentrate to zinc
oxide:[90]
2 ZnS + 3 O
2 → 2 ZnO + 2 SO
2
The sulfur dioxide is used for the production of sulfuric
acid, which is necessary for the leaching process. If deposits
of zinc carbonate, zinc silicate, or zinc spinel (like
the Skorpion Deposit in Namibia) are used for zinc production,
the roasting can be omitted.[92]
For further processing two basic methods are used:
pyrometallurgy or electrowinning. Pyrometallurgy reduces
zinc oxide with carbon or carbon monoxide at 950
°C (1,740 °F) into the metal, which is distilled as zinc
vapor to separate it from other metals, which are not
volatile at those temperatures.[93] The zinc vapor is collected
in a condenser.[90] The equations below describe
this process:[90]
2 ZnO + C → 2 Zn + CO
2
ZnO + CO → Zn + CO
2
In electrowinning, zinc is leached from the ore concentrate
by sulfuric acid:[94]
ZnO + H
2SO
4 → ZnSO
4 + H
2O
Finally, the zinc is reduced by electrolysis.[90]
2 ZnSO
4 + 2 H
2O → 2 Zn + 2 H
2SO
4 + O
2
The sulfuric acid is regenerated and recycled to the leaching
step.
When galvanised feedstock is fed to an electric arc furnace,
the zinc is recovered from the dust by a number of
processes, predominately the Waelz process (90% as of
2014).[95]
4.2 Environmental impact
Refinement of sulfidic zinc ores produces large volumes
of sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor. Smelter slag and
other residues contain significant quantities of metals.
About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand
tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian
towns of La Calamine and Plombières between 1806
and 1882.[96] The dumps of the past mining operations
leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the Geul
River contain non-trivial amounts of metals.[96] About
two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining
and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After
increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at
3.4 million tonnes per year in the 1980s and declined to
2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study
of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations
there did not reflect the decline. Anthropogenic and natural
emissions occur at a ratio of 20 to 1.[97]
Zinc in rivers flowing through industrial and mining areas
can be as high as 20 ppm.[98] Effective sewage treatment
greatly reduces this; treatment along the Rhine, for
example, has decreased zinc levels to 50 ppb.[98] Concentrations
of zinc as low as 2 ppm adversely affects the
amount of oxygen that fish can carry in their blood.[99]
responsible for high metal levels in the Derwent
River,[100] the zinc works at Lutana is the largest exporter
in Tasmania, generating 2.5% of the state’s GDP, and
producing more than 250 000 tonnes of zinc per year.[101]
Soils contaminated with zinc from mining, refining, or
fertilizing with zinc-bearing sludge can contain several
8 5 APPLICATIONS
grams of zinc per kilogram of dry soil. Levels of zinc
in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of
plants to absorb other essential metals, such as iron and
manganese. Zinc levels of 2000 ppm to 180,000 ppm
(18%) have been recorded in some soil samples.[98]
5 Applications
Major applications of zinc include (numbers are given for
the US)[102]
1. Galvanizing (55%)
2. Brass and bronze (16%)
3. Other alloys (21%)
4. Miscellaneous (8%)
5.1 Anti-corrosion and batteries
Hot-dip handrail galvanized crystalline surface
Zinc is most commonly used as an anti-corrosion
agent,[103] and galvanization (coating of iron or steel) is
the most familiar form. In 2009 in the United States,
55% or 893 thousand tonnes of the zinc metal was used
for galvanization.[102]
Zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract
almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes
away.[104] A protective surface layer of oxide and
carbonate (Zn
5(OH)
6(CO
3)
2) forms as the zinc corrodes.[105] This protection lasts
even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through
time as the zinc corrodes away.[105] The zinc is applied
electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot-dip galvanizing
or spraying. Galvanization is used on chain-link
fencing, guard rails, suspension bridges, lightposts, metal
roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies.[17]
The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation
to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in
cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection
of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting
anodes made from zinc to the pipe.[105] Zinc acts as the
anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as
it passes electric current to the steel pipeline.[105][note 2]
Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are
exposed to sea water.[106] A zinc disc attached to a ship’s
iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays
intact.[104] Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller
or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides
temporary protection.
With a standard electrode potential (SEP) of −0.76 volts,
zinc is used as an anode material for batteries. (More
reactive lithium (SEP −3.04 V) is used for anodes in
lithium batteries ). Powdered zinc is used in this way
in alkaline batteries and the case (which also serves as
the anode) of zinc–carbon batteries is formed from sheet
zinc.[107][108] Zinc is used as the anode or fuel of the zincair
battery/fuel cell.[109][110][111] The zinc-cerium redox
flow battery also relies on a zinc-based negative halfcell.[
112]
5.2 Alloys
A widely used zinc alloy is brass, in which copper is alloyed
with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, depending
upon the type of brass.[105] Brass is generally more ductile
and stronger than copper, and has superior corrosion resistance.[
105] These properties make it useful in communication
equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and
water valves.[105]

Other widely used zinc alloys include nickel silver, typewriter
metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial
bronze.[11] Zinc is also used in contemporary pipe
organs as a substitute for the traditional lead/tin alloy in
pipes.[113] Alloys of 85–88% zinc, 4–10% copper, and
2–8% aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine
bearings. Zinc is the primary metal in American

one cent coins (pennies) since 1982.[114] The zinc core is
coated with a thin layer of copper to give the appearance
of a copper coin. In 1994, 33,200 tonnes (36,600 short
tons) of zinc were used to produce 13.6 billion pennies in
the United States.[115]
Alloys of zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium,
and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin
casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware
industries.[11] These alloys are marketed under the
name Zamak.[116] An example of this is zinc aluminium.
The low melting point together with the low viscosity of
the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate
shapes. The low working temperature leads to
rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production
for assembly.[11][117] Another alloy, marketed under the
brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium,
and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel
but as malleable as plastic.[11][118] This superplasticity of
the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of
ceramics and cement.[11]
Similar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead
can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc
and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for
low production run applications for which ferrous metal
dies would be too expensive.[119] For building facades,
roofing, and other applications for sheet metal formed by
deep drawing, roll forming, or bending, zinc alloys with
titanium and copper are used.[120] Unalloyed zinc is too
brittle for these manufacturing processes.[120]
As a dense, inexpensive, easily worked material, zinc is
used as a lead replacement. In the wake of lead concerns,
zinc appears in weights for various applications ranging
from fishing[121] to tire balances and flywheels.[122]
Cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) is a semiconductive alloy
that can be divided into an array of small sensing
devices.[123] These devices are similar to an integrated
circuit and can detect the energy of incoming gamma ray
photons.[123] When behind an absorbing mask, the CZT
sensor array can determine the direction of the rays.[123]
5.3 Other industrial uses
Roughly one quarter of all zinc output in the United States
in 2009 was consumed in zinc compounds;[102] a variety
of which are used industrially. Zinc oxide is widely
used as a white pigment in paints and as a catalyst in
the manufacture of rubber to disburse heat. Zinc oxide
is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from
ultraviolet radiation (UV).[17] The semiconductor properties
of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying
products.[124] The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two
step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide
for hydrogen production.[125]
Zinc chloride is often added to lumber as a fire retardant[
126] and sometimes as a wood preservative.[127] It
Zinc oxide is used as a white pigment in paints.
is used in the manufacture of other chemicals.[126] Zinc
methyl (Zn(CH3)
2) is used in a number of organic syntheses.[128] Zinc sulfide
(ZnS) is used in luminescent pigments such as on
the hands of clocks, X-ray and television screens, and
luminous paints.[129] Crystals of ZnS are used in lasers
that operate in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum.[130]
Zinc sulfate is a chemical in dyes and pigments.[126] Zinc
pyrithione is used in antifouling paints.[131]
Zinc powder is sometimes used as a propellant in model
rockets.[132] When a compressed mixture of 70% zinc
and 30% sulfur powder is ignited there is a violent chemical
reaction.[132] This produces zinc sulfide, together with
large amounts of hot gas, heat, and light.[132]
Zinc sheet metal is used to make zinc bars.[133]
64
Zn, the most abundant isotope of zinc, is very susceptible
to neutron activation, being transmuted into the highly radioactive
65
Zn, which has a half-life of 244 days and produces intense
gamma radiation. Because of this, zinc oxide used
in nuclear reactors as an anti-corrosion agent is depleted
of 64
Zn before use, this is called depleted zinc oxide. For the
same reason, zinc has been proposed as a salting material
for nuclear weapons (cobalt is another, better-known
salting material).[134] A jacket of isotopically enriched 64
Zn would be irradiated by the intense high-energy neutron
flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon, forming a
large amount of 65
Zn significantly increasing the radioactivity of the
weapon’s fallout.[134] Such a weapon is not known to have
ever been built, tested, or used.[134]
65
Zn is used as a tracer to study how alloys that contain zinc
wear out, or the path and the role of zinc in organisms.[135]
Zinc dithiocarbamate complexes are used as agricultural
fungicides; these include Zineb, Metiram, Propineb
10 5 APPLICATIONS
and Ziram.[136] Zinc naphthenate is used as wood
preservative.[137] Zinc in the form of ZDDP, is used as
an anti-wear additive for metal parts in engine oil.[138]
5.4 Dietary supplement
GNC zinc 50 mg tablets (AU)
See also: Zinc sulfate (medical use)
In most single-tablet, over-the-counter, daily vitamin and
mineral supplements, zinc is included in such forms as
zinc oxide, zinc acetate, or zinc gluconate.[139] Zinc is
generally considered to be an antioxidant. However, it
is redox inert and thus can serve such a function only
indirectly.[140] As such, it may protect against accelerated
aging of the skin and muscles of the body; studies differ
as to its effectiveness.[141] Zinc also helps speed up the
healing process after an injury.[141] It is also suspected of
being beneficial to the human immune system, and deficiency
may be deleterious to virtually all parts of the
system.[142]
Zinc deficiency has been associated with major depressive
disorder (MDD), and zinc supplements may be an effective
treatment.[143] Zinc supplementation may reduce
the minimum effective dose of amphetamine when it is
used for the treatment of ADHD.[144]
Zinc serves as a simple, inexpensive, and critical tool for
treating diarrheal episodes among children in the developing
world. Zinc becomes depleted in the body during
diarrhea, but recent studies suggest that replenishing zinc
with a 10- to 14-day course of treatment can reduce the
duration and severity of diarrheal episodes and may also
prevent future episodes for as long as three months.[145]

The Age-Related Eye Disease Study determined that zinc
can be part of an effective treatment for age-related macular
degeneration.[146] Zinc supplement is an effective
treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica, a genetic disorder
affecting zinc absorption that was previously fatal
to affected infants.[56]
Gastroenteritis is strongly attenuated by ingestion of zinc,
possibly by direct antimicrobial action of the ions in the
gastrointestinal tract, or by the absorption of the zinc and
re-release from immune cells (all granulocytes secrete
zinc), or both.[147][148]
In 2011, researchers at John Jay College of Criminal Justice
reported that dietary zinc supplements can mask the
presence of drugs in urine. Similar claims appear in web
forums.[149]
5.5 Zinc lozenges and the common cold
Main article: Zinc and the common cold
In studies of zinc supplements and the common cold, zinc
acetate produced the most positive results, apparently because
acetate does not bind zinc ions.[150][151]
5.6 Topical use
Further information: Zinc oxide § Medicine
Topical preparations of zinc include those used on the
skin, often in the form of zinc oxide. Zinc preparations
can protect against sunburn in the summer and windburn
in the winter.[56] Applied thinly to a baby’s diaper area
(perineum) with each diaper change, it can protect against
diaper rash.[56]

Chelated zinc is used in toothpastes and mouthwashes to
prevent bad breath.[152]
Zinc pyrithione is widely included in shampoos to prevent
dandruff.[153]
Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even at low
concentrations.[154]
5.7 Organic chemistry
Addition of diphenylzinc to an aldehyde
Organozinc chemistry is the science of compounds that
contain carbon-zinc bonds, describing the physical properties,
synthesis, and chemical reactions.Many organozinc
compounds are important.[155][156][157][158] Among
important applications are
 The Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate
ester(ROCOCOOR) reacts with an alkyl halide
R'X, zinc and hydrochloric acid to form the α-
hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR[159]
 The Reformatskii reaction in which α-halo-esters
and aldehydes are converted to β-hydroxy-esters
 The Simmons–Smith reaction in which the
carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc iodide reacts with
alkene(or alkyne) and converts them to cyclopropane
 The Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to
form carbonyl compounds
 The Barbier reaction (1899), which is the zinc
equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and
is the better of the two. In presence of water,
formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail,
whereas the Barbier reaction can take place in water.
 On the downside, organozincs are much less nucleophilic
than Grignards, and they are expensive
and difficult to handle. Commercially available
diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc,
diethylzinc and diphenylzinc. In one study,[160][161]
the active organozinc compound is obtained from
much cheaper organobromine precursors
 The Negishi coupling is also an important reaction
for the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds between
unsaturated carbon atoms in alkenes, arenes
and alkynes. The catalysts are nickel and palladium.
A key step in the catalytic cycle is a
transmetalation in which a zinc halide exchanges its
organic substituent for another halogen with the palladium
(nickel) metal center.
 The Fukuyama coupling is another coupling reaction,
but it uses a thioester as reactant and produces
a ketone.
Zinc has found many applications as catalyst in organic
synthesis including asymmetric synthesis, being cheap
and easily available alternative to precious metal complexes.
The results (yield and ee) obtained with chiral
zinc catalysts are comparable to those achieved with palladium,
ruthenium, iridium and others, and zinc becomes
metal catalyst of choice.[162]
6 Biological role
Zinc is an essential trace element for humans[163][164]
and other animals,[165] for plants[97] and for
microorganisms.[166] Zinc is found in nearly 100
specific enzymes[167] (other sources[168] say 300), serves
as structural ions in transcription factors and is stored
and transferred in metallothioneins.[169] It is “typically
the second most abundant transition metal in organisms”
after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all
enzyme classes.[97]
In proteins, Zinc ions are often coordinated to the amino
acid side chains of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteine
and histidine. The theoretical and computational description
of this zinc binding in proteins (as well as that of
other transition metals) is difficult.[170]
Between 2 and 4 grams of zinc[171] are distributed
throughout the human body. Most zinc is in the brain,
muscle, bones, kidney, and liver, with the highest concentrations
in the prostate and parts of the eye.[172] Semen
is particularly rich in zinc, a key factor in prostate
gland function and reproductive organ growth.[173]
In humans, the biological roles of zinc are
ubiquitous.[8][164] It interacts with “a wide range of
organic ligands",[8] and has roles in the metabolism
of RNA and DNA, signal transduction, and gene
expression. It also regulates apoptosis. A 2006 study
estimated that about 10% of human proteins (2800)
potentially bind zinc, in addition to hundreds more that
transport and traffic zinc; a similar in silico study in
the plant Arabidopsis thaliana found 2367 zinc-related
proteins.[97]
In the brain, zinc is stored in specific synaptic vesicles
by glutamatergic neurons and can modulate neuronal
excitability.[164][174] It plays a key role in synaptic
12 6 BIOLOGICAL ROLE
plasticity and so in learning.[164][175] However, it has
been called “the brain’s dark horse”[174] because it also
can be a neurotoxin, suggesting zinc homeostasis plays
a critical role in the functional regulation of the central
nervous system.[164][174] Dysregulation of zinc homeostasis
in the central nervous system that results in excessive
synaptic zinc concentrations is believed to induce
neurotoxicity through mitochondrial oxidative stress
(e.g., by disrupting certain enzymes involved in the
electron transport chain, including complex I, complex
III, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase), the dysregulation
of calcium homeostasis, glutamatergic neuronal
excitotoxicity, and interference with intraneuronal signal
transduction.[164][176] SLC30A3 is the primary zinc transporter
involved in cerebral zinc homeostasis.[164]
6.1 Enzymes
Ribbon diagram of human carbonic anhydrase II, with zinc atom
visible in the center
Zinc fingers help read DNA sequences.
Zinc is an efficient Lewis acid, making it a useful
catalytic agent in hydroxylation and other enzymatic
reactions.[167] The metal also has a flexible coordination
geometry, which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift
conformations to perform biological reactions.[177] Two
examples of zinc-containing enzymes are carbonic anhydrase
and carboxypeptidase, which are vital to the processes
of carbon dioxide (CO
2) regulation and digestion of proteins, respectively.[178]
In vertebrate blood, carbonic anhydrase converts CO
2 into bicarbonate and the same enzyme transforms the
bicarbonate back into CO
2 for exhalation through the lungs.[179] Without this enzyme,
this conversion would occur about one million
times slower[180] at the normal blood pH of 7 or would require
a pH of 10 or more.[181] The non-related β-carbonic
anhydrase is required in plants for leaf formation, the synthesis
of indole acetic acid (auxin) and alcoholic fermentation.[
182]
Carboxypeptidase cleaves peptide linkages during digestion
of proteins. A coordinate covalent bond is formed
between the terminal peptide and a C=O group attached
to zinc, which gives the carbon a positive charge. This
helps to create a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme near
the zinc, which attracts the non-polar part of the protein
being digested.[178]
6.2 Other proteins
Zinc serves a purely structural role in zinc fingers,
twists and clusters.[183] Zinc fingers form parts of some
transcription factors, which are proteins that recognize
DNA base sequences during the replication and transcription
of DNA. Each of the nine or ten Zn2+
ions in a zinc finger helps maintain the finger’s structure
by coordinately binding to four amino acids in the
transcription factor.[180] The transcription factor wraps
around the DNA helix and uses its fingers to accurately
bind to the DNA sequence.
In blood plasma, zinc is bound to and transported by
albumin (60%, low-affinity) and transferrin (10%).[171]
Because transferrin also transports iron, excessive iron reduces
zinc absorption, and vice versa. A similar antagonism
exists with copper.[184] The concentration of zinc in
blood plasma stays relatively constant regardless of zinc
intake.[185] Cells in the salivary gland, prostate, immune
system, and intestine use zinc signaling to communicate
with other cells.[186]
Zinc may be held in metallothionein reserves within microorganisms
or in the intestines or liver of animals.[187]
Metallothionein in intestinal cells is capable of adjusting
absorption of zinc by 15–40%.[188] However, inadequate
or excessive zinc intake can be harmful; excess
zinc particularly impairs copper absorption because metallothionein
absorbs both metals.[189]
The human dopamine transporter contains a high affinity

Deficiency 13
induced dopamine efflux in vitro.[190][191][192] The human
serotonin transporter and norepinephrine transporter do
not contain zinc binding sites.[192]
6.3 Dietary reference intake
The Food and Nutrition Board of the U.S. Institute
of Medicine updated Estimated Average Requirements
(EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs)
for zinc in 2001. The current EARs for zinc for women
and men ages 14 and up are 6.8 mg/day and 9.4 mg/day,
respectively. The RDAs are 8 and 11 mg/day. RDAs are
higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover
people with higher than average requirements. RDA for
pregnancy equals 11 mg/day. RDA for lactation equals
12 mg/day. For infants up to 12 months the RDA is 3
mg/day and for children ages 1–13 years the RDA increases
with age from 3 to 8 mg/day. As for safety, the
Food and Nutrition Board also sets Tolerable Upper Intake
Levels (known as ULs) for vitamins and minerals
when evidence is sufficient. In the case of zinc the UL is
set at 40 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs and ULs
are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes.[193] The European
Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety
question and set its UL at 25 mg/day.[194]
For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes
the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily
Value (%DV). For zinc labeling purposes 100% of the
Daily Value was 15 mg, but as of May 2016 it has been
revised to 11 mg. A table of the pre-change adult Daily
Values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. Food and
supplement companies have until July 28, 2018 to comply
with the change.
6.4 Dietary intake
Animal-sourced foods (meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs,
dairy) provide zinc. The concentration of zinc in plants
varies with the level in the soil. With adequate zinc in
the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are
wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds (sesame, poppy,
alfalfa, celery, mustard).[195] Zinc is also found in beans,
nuts, almonds, whole grains, pumpkin seeds, sunflower
seeds and blackcurrant.[196]
Other sources include fortified food and dietary supplements
in various forms. A 1998 review concluded that
zinc oxide, one of the most common supplements in the
United States, and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and
poorly absorbed in the body.[197] This review cited studies
that found lower plasma zinc concentrations in the subjects
who consumed zinc oxide and zinc carbonate than
in those who took zinc acetate and sulfate salts.[197] For
fortification, however, a 2003 review recommended cereals
(containing zinc oxide) as a cheap, stable source that
is as easily absorbed as the more expensive forms.[198] A
2005 study found that various compounds of zinc, includ-
Foods & spices containing zinc
ing oxide and sulfate, did not show statistically significant
differences in absorption when added as fortificants to
maize tortillas.[199]
6.5 Deficiency
Main article: Zinc deficiency
Zinc deficiency is usually due to insufficient dietary
intake, but can be associated with malabsorption,
acrodermatitis enteropathica, chronic liver disease,
chronic renal disease, sickle cell disease, diabetes, malignancy,
and other chronic illnesses.[9] Groups at risk for
zinc deficiency include the elderly, children in developing
countries, and those with renal dysfunction.
In the United States, a federal survey of food consumption
determined that for women and men over the age of 19,
average consumption was 9.7 and 14.2 mg/day, respectively.
For women, 17% consumed less than the EAR, for
men 11%. The percentages below EAR increased with
age.[200] The most recent published update of the survey
(NHANES 2013-2014) reported lower averages - 9.3 and
13.2 mg/day - again with intake decreasing with age.[201]
Symptoms of mild zinc deficiency are diverse.[202] Clinical
outcomes include depressed growth, diarrhea, impotence
and delayed sexual maturation, alopecia, eye and
14 8 PRECAUTIONS
skin lesions, impaired appetite, altered cognition, impaired
host defense properties, defects in carbohydrate
utilization, and reproductive teratogenesis.[185] Mild zinc
deficiency depresses immunity,[203] although excessive
zinc does also.[171] Animals with a zinc deficiency require
twice as much food to attain the same weight gain as animals
with sufficient zinc.[129]
Despite some concerns,[204] western vegetarians and vegans
do not suffer any more from overt zinc deficiency
than meat-eaters.[205] Major plant sources of zinc include
cooked dried beans, sea vegetables, fortified cereals, soy
foods, nuts, peas, and seeds.[204] However, phytates in
many whole-grains and fibers may interfere with zinc
absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood
effects. The zinc chelator phytate, found in seeds
and cereal bran, can contribute to zinc malabsorption.[9]
Some evidence suggests that more than the US RDA (15
mg) of zinc daily may be needed in those whose diet
is high in phytates, such as some vegetarians.[204] These
considerations must be balanced against the paucity of adequate
zinc biomarkers, and the most widely used indicator,
plasma zinc, has poor sensitivity and specificity.[206]
Diagnosing zinc deficiency is a persistent challenge.[8]
Nearly two billion people in the developing world are
deficient in zinc.[9] In children, it causes an increase
in infection and diarrhea and contributes to the death
of about 800,000 children worldwide per year.[8] The
World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation
for severe malnutrition and diarrhea.[207] Zinc supplements
help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially
among children with low birth weight or stunted
growth.[207] However, zinc supplements should not be administered
alone, because many in the developing world
have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other
micronutrients.[208]
7 Soil remediation
The Ericoid Mycorrhizal Fungi Calluna, Erica and Vaccinium
can grow in zinc metalliferous soils.[209]
7.1 Agriculture
Zinc deficiency appears to be the most common micronutrient
deficiency in crop plants; it is particularly common
in high-pH soils.[210] Zinc-deficient soil is cultivated in
the cropland of about half of Turkey and India, a third
of China, and most of Western Australia. Substantial responses
to zinc fertilization have been reported in these
areas.[97] Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient
are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is added to the soil
primarily through the weathering of rocks, but humans
have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine
waste, phosphate fertilizers, pesticide (zinc phosphide),
limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized
surfaces. Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although
zinc toxicity is far less widespread.[97]
8 Precautions
Main article: Zinc toxicity
8.1 Toxicity
Although zinc is an essential requirement for good health,
excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc
suppresses copper and iron absorption.[189] The free zinc
ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and
even vertebrate fish.[211] The Free Ion Activity Model
is well-established in the literature, and shows that just
micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms.
A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of
all Daphnia in water.[212]
The free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point
of being corrosive. Stomach acid contains hydrochloric
acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive
zinc chloride. Swallowing a post-1982 American
one cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the
stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion
in the acidic stomach.[213]
Evidence shows that people taking 100–300 mg of zinc
daily may suffer induced copper deficiency. A 2007 trial
observed that elderly men taking 80 mg daily were hospitalized
for urinary complications more often than those
taking a placebo.[214] Levels of 100–300 mg may interfere
with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely
affect cholesterol.[189] Zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil
interferes with the plant absorption of other essential metals,
such as iron and manganese.[98] A condition called
the zinc shakes or “zinc chills” can be induced by inhalation
of zinc fumes while brazing or welding galvanized
materials.[129] Zinc is a common ingredient of denture
cream which may contain between 17 and 38 mg of zinc
per gram. Disability and even deaths from excessive use
of these products have been claimed.[215]
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states
that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose, causing
anosmia. Reports of anosmia were also observed in the
1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt
to prevent polio infections.[216] On June 16, 2009,
the FDA ordered removal of zinc-based intranasal cold
products from store shelves. The FDA said the loss of
smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired
smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke, and cannot
tell if food has spoiled before they eat it.[217]
Recent research suggests that the topical antimicrobial
zinc pyrithione is a potent heat shock response inducer
that may impair genomic integrity with induc15
tion of PARP-dependent energy crisis in cultured human
keratinocytes and melanocytes.[218]
8.2 Poisoning
In 1982, the US Mint began minting pennies coated in
copper but containing primarily zinc. The new zinc pennies
pose a risk of zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One
reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1
kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial
and fungal sepsis. Another patient who ingested 12
grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia (gross lack
of coordination of muscle movements).[219] Several other
cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication
by the ingestion of zinc coins.[220][221]
Pennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by
dogs, requiring veterinary removal of the foreign objects.
The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity,
commonly fatal in dogs through severe hemolytic anemia
and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea
are possible symptoms.[222] Zinc is highly toxic in parrots
and poisoning can often be fatal.[223] The consumption of
fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass
parrot poisonings with zinc.[56]
